What is it?
===========
*Sight* is the Syntax Highlighter Chrome extension that makes reading code on the browser a joy.
You can choose the theme and font on the options page. Line numbers added on v1.4.
Highlighting code based on [Highlight.js](https://github.com/isagalaev/highlight.js).

I want it! But how?
===================
You can now [install it](http://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/epmaefhielclhlnmjofcdapbeepkmggh) on the Google Chrome Gallery.

After installing just access any github raw url to [try it out](http://github.com/tsenart/sight/raw/master/js/content_script.js).
